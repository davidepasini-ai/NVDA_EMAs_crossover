This is my own very first project in Python and for algorithmic trading. I begun this project for fun, after I begun seriously guessing price rises for a few stock tickers of my liking with informed decisions mostly based on personal intuition and sentiment analysis done by myself. I quickly realized that:
<ul>
  <li>Though successful (9% monthly returns), my performance was as good as my daily time commitment and analysis to preparing for market open</li>
  <li>90% of my losses where due to FOMO or the hope that a losing trade would bounce back</li>
</ul>


# Strategy returns
